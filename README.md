Homework 3

I had some trouble getting the responsiveness to be perfect down to a small mobile level. I think I have something still taking up too much horizontal width, but I haven't quite found it yet.

I used:

getbootstrap
w3schools
stackoverflow
The koala website
The LESS getting started website
